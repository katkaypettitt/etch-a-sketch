> Virtual etch-a-sketch made with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## General info

Move your arrow keys to move the etch-a-sketch cursor and draw whatever you like! The colour changes as you move and the pointer will start in a random location. If you do not like your cursor location, just refresh the screen.

The 'Shake!' button resets the board and shakes the canvas, just like a real etch-a-sketch.
